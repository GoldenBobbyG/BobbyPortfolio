            <p>I'm Robert Strickland (Robb), a full-stack development student who attended the University of Minnesota's Software Development Full-Stack Certificate Program. 
               I discovered coding in 1998 when a friend of my father came and, which I didn't know at the time, coded to set up, test, and install some hardware for my first computer. 
               Ever since that day, coding was me.
            </p>

            <p>This curiosity led me to explore various programming languages and technologies, allowing me to develop solutions that bridge the gap between logistics and technology. Over the years, 
               Iâ€™ve honed my skills through hands-on experience, formal training, and continuous learning, with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable applications.
            </p>

            <p>In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a diverse collection of projects that reflect my journey in coding and problem-solving. MyReads is a dynamic book-tracking application that enhances user experience by managing and categorizing reading lists. Challenge-WK8Vehicle-Builder showcases an interactive vehicle customization tool, 
               demonstrating my ability to build user-friendly and functional applications. NineToFiveTracker is a time-tracking tool designed to improve productivity and efficiency. 
               Each repository highlights my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for developing impactful software solutions.
