            <p>My name is Robert Strickland and I am a Full Stack Developer. I have a background in the culinary arts and have been working 
                in the restaurant industry for over 20 years. I have always had a passion for technology and have been teaching myself how 
                to code for the past year. I am currently enrolled in the University of Central Florida's 
                Coding Bootcamp and will be graduating in December 2021. I am excited to start my new career 
                as a developer and am looking forward to the opportunities that await me.</p>
